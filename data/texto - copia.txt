Desmond has his barrow in the marketplace
Molly is the singer in a band
Desmond says to Molly, "Girl, I like your face"
And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand

Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah
La-la, how their life goes on
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah
La-la, how their life goes on

Desmond takes a trolley to the jeweller's store (choo-choo)
Buys a twenty-carat golden ring (ring)
Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door
And as he gives it to her, she begins to sing (sing)
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah

La-la, how their life goes on
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah
La-la, how their life goes on

In a couple of years they have built a home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones (ha-ha-ha-ha) Happy ever after in the marketplace
Desmond lets the children lend a hand

Molly stays at home and does her pretty face
And in the evening she still sings it with the band, yes

Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah
La-la, how their life goes on (yeah)
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah
La-la, how their life goes on

In a couple of years they have built a home sweet home

Happy ever after in the marketplace
Molly lets the children lend a hand
